## [React plasma background]()

A small library built in near 2-3 days. May be used to provide some beautiful backgrounds with **plasma effect** on them.

Build on top of **React**, and applied just with single component. To find more info you can refer to [npm]() or [github](). In short word, I used [CSS Animations]() API to achieve such effect, not SVGs just regular CSS. So maybe there are some issues related to perfomance

The project is under development. of course, you can use it for now, but there may be some issues, some really critical issues (eg no support for react-19 which is being investigated by me). Some basic functionality was already provided, but maybe you won't find the things you want. Feel free to provide your feedback about the project.

An example of this library you can find in my portfolio (just right here XD). I hope you like it.
