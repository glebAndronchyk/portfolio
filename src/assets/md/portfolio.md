## [Portfolio](https://github.com/glebAndronchyk/react-plasma-background)

A small portfolio application that was built in 1 day. For the first time i decided to use [lenis](https://lenis.darkroom.engineering/) for smooth scrolling and [gsap](https://gsap.com/) for animations.

Current status is under development. Basic layout and features were provided. But my goal is to improve accessibility/UI/animations. Some of the components may be put into custom library. So the goals are huge. All I need it's time to finish this things :D

An application built using `React` as a core library.
