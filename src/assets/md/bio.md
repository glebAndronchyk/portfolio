#### Middle Front-End Engineer (React/TS/JS/Node.js)

Hi, I'm a front-end developer who loves turning ideas into engaging experiences. I am proficient in **JS/TS/CSS/React.js/Tailwind/Node.js** and many other technologies that can help accelerate the implementation of your ideas.

Regarding my work experience, I have built cross-platform projects using **React Native** and **Electron.js**. I have also developed small APIs for internal company features and personal projects. Additionally, I have had some exposure to embedded development and OS implementations. However, my primary focus is on building web solutions using **React**.

I have published several libraries on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~tapoch3k). Feel free to check them out—you might find something interesting there!

I'm also a bit of a math enthusiast, so I’d be especially excited to work on 2D/3D graphical calculations or even game development.
